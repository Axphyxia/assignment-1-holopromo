### Patch 7.00 Final Patch
# assignment-1-holopromo
A website with the goal to promote a company called Hololive to hopefully encourage more people to join the Hololive community.
I've made it so that, it is split into multiple sections all so to help the user to better understand what is hololive and to hopefully help convince them to give it a try.
## Design Process
This website is mainly intended towards people who didn't know about hololive prior to this website
and this website would hopefully give them enough insight to give watching hololive a try.

Section 1 (Header) - It features two banners, one that leads to the website to purhcase the current hololive event tickets that's going to happen in December. With the banner holding information about the dates of the event and an anchor point to lead them to a more detailed website. This is to inform them of the concert so if in the future, they could possibly be interested in such an event. The other banner is just to lead to the official website of hololive.

Section 2 (CEO) - Here features some details about the CEO of hololive, Mr Motoaki Tanigo san, this is to help the user of my website to better understand, who is the one that owns hololive and dictates everything. Starting with what he looks like, his name, his work and study history and his personal twitter that he oftenly uses.

Section 3 (About hololive) - This section is to now help the user to better understand, what is hololive, as up until this point, nothing much was mentioned. Starting with the vision of how hololive became a thing, then a better and more detailed explanation of what hololive is from the ceo himself with two 4 minutes plus videos, short and simple by KirinukiChannel that translated the original clip.

Section 4 (Works from the talents) - This is to help give the user some idea of what do the hololive members do. Starting with the hololive no grafiti showing the weekly anime series featuring short comedic sketches, this was used as it may interest people who are in to these sorts of things like, comedic sketches and anime. 
The second video shows the more musical side of hololive with them performing their first official song that is entirely original and animated. This is done so to attract people who are more into the music video side of things with the third video as well, showcasing Hoshimachi Suisei and her own original song.
The last video features the current most viewed video of hololive, featuring Minato Aqua's cover of an original song, boasting a whopping 6.8 million views.

Section 5(Meet the talents) - The final section is to show all of the talents currently in hololive, with their names and anchors in the images to bring the user to their youtube channels, and a little section below the name that showcases their nicknames and or insider memes, like "Elite Miko" and "Adidas lion" to give a bit of insight for the user, before attempting to try them out.

### Media

### Some bugs
-For Firefox users, the iframes will duplicate after 2 iframes, the third and fourth iframe will be duplicates of the first. This is an issue of Firefox, and i can do nothing about it. To solve it however, all the user needs to do is to hold "control" + "Shift" and press "r", this will hard reset the website and fix the issue.
